## Step 4: Verify Everything Works

Check these admin dashboard pages:
- âœ… **Dashboard** - Should load without errors
- âœ… **Users** - Should show your user account
- âœ… **Whales** - Should show sample whales (BTC, ETH icons)
- âœ… **Announcements** - Should show the welcome message
- âœ… **Transactions** - Will be empty (normal - they're from blockchain APIs)
- âœ… **Analytics** - Should show user statistics

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid credentials or unauthorized access"
- Run the SQL fix again
- Make sure your email in the SQL matches exactly
- Clear browser cache and try again

### "Column 'articles' does not exist"
- The SQL fix creates views for table aliases
- Make sure you ran the ENTIRE SQL script
- Check Supabase logs for errors

### Edge Functions returning 500
- Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Supabase Edge Functions settings
- The functions will work once the API key is configured
- Until then, AI features will show errors (this is expected)

### "Permission denied" errors
- Your user role must be 'Administrator'
- Verify with: `SELECT role FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email';`
- Should return 'Administrator'
