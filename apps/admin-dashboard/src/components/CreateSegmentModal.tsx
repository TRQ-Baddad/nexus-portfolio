// This file is deprecated and no longer in use.
// The "Create Segment" functionality for users is handled by `components/CreateSegmentModal.tsx` in the main application.
// Pre-defined, global segments are hardcoded in the `hooks/useWhaleSegments.ts` hook.
// This file is retained to prevent breaking import paths but should be removed in a future refactor.
